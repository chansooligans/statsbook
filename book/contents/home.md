# statsbook

I started this jupyter-book to assist in workshops that I lead for the Research and Analytics Department
at the New York State Office of the Attorney General. As part of my role as a data scientist, I 
frequently teach statistics and machine learning topics to colleagues in our department, analysts 
in different departments, attorneys, and even the court. 

These notes are still under development and I continue to revisit sections. The book contains 
notes for statistics fundamentals and machine learning, from probability distributions to recurrent 
neural networks. 

The book contains a combination of original content and study notes from classes and around the web.
